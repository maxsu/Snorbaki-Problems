    "After each minute, one of them is randomly toggled (i.e. - if it's on it turns off and if it's off it turns on). If, at any moment, all the lightbulbs are off, a monster comes and eats Mars.\n",

Let $\\Pi = \\text{diag}(\\pi)$ be the diagonal matrix with $\\pi$ along its diagonal. Let $A =  \\pi^T \\pi$ be the matrix such that $A_{ij} = \\pi_i \\pi_j$.
