    "After inciting jealousy among their peers for his amazing math problems, Mars Industrial is kidnapped and placed in a room with 4 lightbulbs, all starting on.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each minute, one of them is randomly toggled (i.e. - if it's on it turns off and if it's off it turns on). If, at any moment, all the lightbulbs are off, a monster comes and eats Mars.\n",

    "Let $\\pi = (1/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/4, 1/16)$ be the stationary row vector of $P$. (Ie.,  $\\pi$ is the unique vector such that $\\pi\\, P = \\pi$.) Let $\\Pi = \\text{diag}(\\pi)$ be the diagonal matrix with $\\pi$ along its diagonal. Let $A =  \\pi^T \\pi$ be the matrix such that $A_{ij} = \\pi_i \\pi_j$. Let $L = \\Pi(I - P)$ be the 'normalized Laplacian' of $P$. Finally, define the 'fundamental matrix':\n",
